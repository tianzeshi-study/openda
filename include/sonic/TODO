This project still needs some enhancements:

Security hardening
------------------
This project should be fuzzed, not just for sound inputs, but for settings
outside normal ranges, such as setting the speed to 1.0e10.  Sonic should be
secure against attacker-controlled audio signals .  However libsonic on some
systems may run at elevated privileges, and may be controlled through APIs
available in user space.

Unit tests
----------
Sonic is now widely used, and should be properly covered by unit tests.
